# Class Abstraction and Encapsulation

## Class abstraction is the separation of class implementation from the use of a class. The details of implementation are encapsulated and hidden from the user. This is known as class encapsulation.

As another example, consider getting a loan. A specific loan can be viewed as an object
of a Loan class. Interest rate, loan amount, and loan period are its data properties, and computing
monthly payment and total payment are its functions.

You can then use the functions to find the monthly payment and total payment
of your loan. As a user of the Loan class, you donâ€™t need to know how these functions are
implemented.
